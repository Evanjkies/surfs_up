## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to establish a presentable set of data that describes the temperature in Oahu Hawaii for the purpose of determining weather a surfing a icecream shop would be sustainable year round. Specifically, looking into the climate in this area during June and December.

## Results
- It is hotter, on average in June than December
- There is a larger range of temperatures in December compared to June
- The standard deviation is larger for the December temperatures compared to June

## Summary
With the range of temperatures in June being from 64 to 85, with a mean of ~75, it seems like there should be no worried about the sustainability of the store during this month. With December's range of temperatures being from 56 to 83, with a mean of 71, it seems like there may be more concern about the business during this time with temperatures seemingly dipping below "warm" on a normal basis. However, this data is obviously not enough to make any type of determination about the climate in the area and subsequently the potential store's sustainablity. Ideally, querying the data for precipitation patters would be part of this analysis. June may seem like a great month for the store based on temperature alone, but it could turn out that it's also the rainiest month of the year for Oahu. Also, doing this analysis for the entire year for both temperature and rain would prove useful for determining trends month to month.
