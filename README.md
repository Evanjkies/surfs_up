## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if a possible surfing and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii would be sustainable year round based on temperature data from June and December in this area.

## Results
- Based on average temperatures, June is hotter than December
- The range between minimum and maximum temperatures is larger in December compared to June
- The standard deviation for temperatures is larger in December than in June

## Summary
Based on the temperatures in June, with the range being 64 to 85 and the average being ~75 it seems as though that this would be a sustainable month for the store. With the Decemeber temperatures having a range of 56 to 83 and the average being 71 it would seem as though the store's sustainability would be less sure during this time. Having only the temperature data for just two months though is obviously not enough to paint the picture we need. If I could add a couple additional queries to this analysis I would first add one for the precipitation. June may seem like a great month for the store just based on the temperature data but it could also be rainiest month of the year for Oahu, which would not bode will for the store. I would also query this temperature and precipitation data for the entire year as oppose to just two months. This would provide a better idea of the trends throughout the year.
